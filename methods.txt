Three lab groups led by PIs Sosik, Rynearson, and Menden-Deuer provide size-fractionated chlorophyll data from CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER Transect cruises. Methods specific to each lab group are distinguished in each section of methods below.
The Sosik lab methods are used for the data that we are including from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI).

# CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER Transect cruises

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system.

Sosik: At surface locations and at additional depths at high-priority stations, samples were collected for both <10 micron and whole seawater size fractions, with <10 micron sampling at depth targeted to the subsurface chlorophyll max (SCM) and another depth with detectable CTD fluorescence. At the remaining locations, samples were not size-fractioned. For each sample, two to three replicate bottles were filled from each Niskin and were stored in a cooler until filtered on-ship. Some samples were collected at the surface with a bucket.

Rynearson: Samples were collected from all LTER stations aiming for 12 samples per station comprised of 2 size fractions (>5 and >20 micron) from each of 3 (sometimes 4) depths: surface, SCM, and below SCM (or other. For each depth, two replicate bottles were filled with seawater and returned to the ship's lab for filtering. 
On cruise EN608 only: Samples were collected from 4-8 depths from each LTER station. Each Niskin sampled was used to fill duplicate sample bottles for whole seawater and for smaller size fractions, which varied by station. Samples were kept in a cooler until filtered.

Menden-Deuer: The Menden-Deuer group conducts incubation experiments at some LTER stations; chlorophyll is provided here only for the starting point (time zero). Seawater from 2-4 Niskins collected near the surface (and sometimes at depth) is transferred to a 10-L polycarbonate carboy through a 200 micron mesh prefilter. Triplicate 120-150 mL subsamples were collected from the carboys for each of the size fractions, which included >20, >10, >5, and >0 microns for cruises EN608, EN617, and EN627; since cruise EN644 only the >10 and >0 microns.

#  Chlorophyll Filtering Protocol

Sosik: For each sample, a known volume was poured through a GF/F filter under low vacuum suction (5-10 in. Hg). The <10 micron size fraction was separated using a filter funnel containing a 10 micron Nitex mesh screen above the GF/F. Filters were transferred to tissue capsules and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. Typically 2 replicates were filtered from a given Niskin bottle, and these are indicated by a or b in the data table.

Rynearson: Size fractionation was accomplished by pouring one bottle from each depth through a 5 micron Sterlitech polycarbonate filter and one through a 20 micron Sterlitech polycarbonate filter under low vacuum suction (5-10 in. Hg). Filters were transferred to 5 mL cryogenic vials and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. Rynearson lab group usually has 2 replicates from the same niskin bottle, indicated by a or b in the data table.
On cruise EN608 only: Samples were filtered by homogenizing a 1-L bottle and pouring 200 mL through each of a 5 micron polycarbonate filter and a 20 micron polycarbonate filter with vacuum <20 kpa. Each filter was transferred to a tube containing 6 mL of 90% acetone previously chilled to -20 C, returned to -20 C, and extracted 20-30 hours later.

Menden-Deuer: Size fractionation was accomplished by pouring each sample through a GF/F (nominal 0.7 micron pore size) or 25 mm-diameter 5 micron (Poretics Polyester GVS Life Sciences), 10 micron (Isopore PolyCarbonate Millipore), or 20 micron (Polycarbonate Maine Manufacturing) filter on a manifold with vacuum not exceeding 200 mBar.  Filters were transferred to glass tubes containing 6 mL 95% ethanol at room temperature, which were then stored in darkness at room temperature for 12 h +/-2 h prior to reading on board ship. Menden-Deuer lab group usually has 3 replicates from multiple niskin bottles combined from same depth, indicated by a, b, or c in the data table.

# Laboratory chlorophyll a measurement

Sosik: Back at the shore lab, filters were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and transferred to glass test tubes. They were then extracted in 5 mL of 90% acetone for 24 hours on ice in a dark refrigerator. They were then vortexed and centrifuged. The solution was measured on a Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer, acidified with 3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples, and the fluorometer was calibrated approximately annually using a serial dilution of a commercially available stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich). 

Rynearson: Filters for the Rynearson group are extracted in the tubes in which they are frozen with the same protocol as the Sosik group, then vortexed (not centrifuged), and read on the same Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer as the Sosik group.
On cruise EN608 only: Tubes were removed from freezer shortly before processing, vortexed for 10 seconds, and (begining with cast 15) centrifuged for 3 minutes. The supernatant was measured on a Turner Designs 10-AU-005 Benchtop Fluorometer, acidified with 2-3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples. Note eight of the exact same water samples on cruise EN608 were run by both the Sosik and Rynearson labs.

Menden-Deuer: Out at sea, in the presence of only red light each tube was vortexed for 10 seconds, and its solution was then poured into a new tube and measured on a Turner Designs 10-AU-005 Benchtop Fluorometer. Two drops of 10% hydrochloric acid were added to each tube, and it was measured again. If the reading after acidification was the same as the reading before acidification, an additional drop of acid was added. Tubes were measured 30 seconds to one hour after acidification. Before and after each batch of samples, a blank, blank + acid, and a solid standard were measured. 

# Data Assembly and Cleaning

The data table was assembled from four sources: 1) the source data for the REST Application Programming Interface (API) of the NES-LTER data system, 2) data sheets provided by the Menden-Deuer lab, 3) a data sheet provided by the Rynearson lab for cruise EN608, and 4) a data sheet from the OOI Alfresco document server. 
Assembly starts in the main R markdown by concatenating LTER and JP cruises called from the NES-LTER REST API for values measured for the Sosik and Rynearson labs, and separately concatenating cruises provided by the Menden-Deuer lab.
We add CTD bottle metadata (time, latitude, longitude, depth) from the NES-LTER REST API, identify when there are corresponding samples with values measured for multiple lab groups for the same (or paired) cast at same depth, then merge the REST API and Menden-Deuer data.
In a separate R markdown we join additional cruises from the REST API of the NES-LTER data system with the OOI data sheet to add the identifier for those samples for which OOI is the authoritative data source. Please refer to the R markdown for the exact version of the EXCEL file accessed via web services from the OOI Alfresco document server for Cruise Data from the Coastal Pioneer Array.
Then in the main R markdown we add those cruises in collaboration with OOI to the compiled data table.
For all records, we calculated the distance to the nearest NES-LTER standard station L1 to L13 (standard for cruises starting with EN617 in August 2018).
The final step in data assembly is the addition of a quality code for the Sosik and Rynearson values that is not yet provided through the REST API.
Data cleaning included rounding values. Some hard-coding was needed to match some records to CTD bottle metadata. Note there were 27 samples lacking CTD bottle metadata.
Data assembly, data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-chl-transect.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We checked differences between replicates, visually inspected plots of chl values colored by filter size, and performed range checks. We confirm that all values provided for the OOI-funded replicates are equivalent to the data sheet as in the OOI Alfresco. We provide a column in the data table to indicate quality using IODE Primary Level flags 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data.
