Three lab groups led by PIs Sosik, Rynearson, and Menden-Deuer provide size-fractionated chlorophyll data from CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER cruises. Methods specific to each lab group are distinguished in each section of methods below.
The Sosik lab methods are used for the data that we are including from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI).

# CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER cruises

Sosik: Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. At surface locations and at additional depths at high-priority stations, samples were collected for both <10 micron and whole seawater size fractions, with <10 micron sampling at depth targeted to the chl max and another depth with detectable CTD fluorescence. At the remaining locations, samples were not size-fractioned. For each sample, two to three duplicate bottles were filled from each Niskin and were stored in a cooler until filtered on-ship. Some samples were collected at the surface with a bucket.

Rynearson: Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Samples were collected from all LTER stations with a total of 12 samples per station comprised of 2 size fractions from each of 3 (sometimes 4) depths: surface, chl max, below max (or other). For each depth, two bottles were filled with seawater and returned to the ship's lab for filtering. 
On cruise EN608 only: Samples were collected from 4-8 depths from each LTER station. Each Niskin sampled was used to fill duplicate sample bottles for whole seawater and for smaller size fractions, which varied by station, were focused on surface, subsurface chlorophyll max (SCM), and below SCM, and included  >= 5 microns, >= 20 microns, and =< 10 microns. Samples were kept in a cooler until filtered. 

Menden-Deuer: The Menden-Deuer group conducts incubation experiments; chlorophyll is provided here only for the starting point (time zero). At each depth, 2-4 Niskins were filled and their seawater transferred to a 10-L polycarbonate carboy through a 200 micron mesh prefilter. Triplicate 120-150 mL subsamples were collected from the carboys for each of the size fractions, which included >20, >10, >5, and >0 microns for cruises EN608, EN617, and EN627; since cruise EN644 only the >10 and >0 microns. The suite of size fractions measured varied acrcoss cruises and stations.

#  Chlorophyll Filtering Protocol

Sosik: For each sample, a known volume was poured through a GF/F filter under low vacuum suction (5-10 in. Hg). The <10 micron size fraction was separated using a filter funnel containing a 10 micron Nitex mesh screen. Filters were transferred to tissue capsules and frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. 

Rynearson: Size fractionation was accomplished by pouring one bottle from each depth through a 5 micron Sterlitech polycarbonate filter and one through a 20 micron Sterlitech polycarbonate filter under low vacuum suction. Filters were transferred to 5 mL cryogenic vials and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. 
On cruise EN608 only: Whole seawater was filtered by pouring the entire contents of each sample bottle through a 25 mm Whatman GF/F filter on a manifold with vacuum <20 kpa. Size-fractioned samples were filtered by homogenizing a 1-L bottle and pouring 200 mL through each of a 5 micron polycarbonate filter, a 20 micron polycarbonate, and a GF/F with a 10 micron mesh prefilter. Each filter was either transferred to a tube containing 6 mL of 90% acetone previously chilled to -20 C, returned to -20 C, and extracted 20-28 hours later; or transferred to a filter capsule and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for extraction on a later date. 

Menden-Deuer: Size fractionation was accomplished by pouring each sample through a GF/F (nominal 0.7 micron pore size) or 25-mm 5um (Poretics Polyester GVS Life Sciences), 10um (Isopore PolyCarbonate Millipore), or 20um (Polycarbonate Maine Manufacturing) filter on a manifold with vacuum not exceeding 200 mBar.  Filters were transferred to glass tubes containing 6 mL 95% ethanol at room temperature, which were then stored in darkness at room temperature for 12 h +/-2 h prior to reading on board ship. 

# Laboratory chlorophyll a measurement

Sosik: Filters were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and transferred to glass test tubes. They were then extracted in 5 mL of 90% acetone for 24 hours on ice in a dark refrigerator. They were then vortexed and centrifuged. The solution was measured on a Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer, acidified with 3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples, and the fluorometer was calibrated approximately annually using a serial dilution of a commercially available stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich). 

Rynearson: Filters were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and extracted in 5 mL of 90% acetone for 24 hours on ice in a dark refrigerator. They were then vortexed, and the solution was measured on a Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer, acidified with 3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples, and the fluorometer was calibrated approximately annually using a serial dilution of a commercially available stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich). 
On cruise EN608 only: Tubes were removed from freezer shortly before processing, vortexed for 10 seconds, and centrifuged for 3 minutes. The supernatant was measured on a Turner Designs 10-AU-005 Benchtop Fluorometer or Turner Aquafluor Fluorometer, acidified with 2-3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples.

Menden-Deuer: In the presence of only red light, each tube was vortexed for 10 seconds, and its solution was then poured into a new tube and measured on a Turner Designs 10-AU-005 Benchtop Fluorometer. Two drops of 10% hydrochloric acid were added to each tube, and it was measured again. If the reading after acidification was the same as the reading before acidification, an additional drop of acid was added. Tubes were measured 30 seconds to one hour after acidification. Before and after each batch of samples, a blank, blank + acid, and a solid standard were measured. 

# Data Assembly and Cleaning

The data table was made by concatenating cruises called from the REST API of the NES-LTER data system, aligning with data sheet(s) from the OOI data system for cruise(s) xx, and adding data sheets provided by the Menden-Deuer lab. 
Some hard-coding will be needed to correct records from the REST API: We'll need to add a second bottle for 4 records from AR24B cast 4 4/6  a,b and 9/10 a,b. The one bucket sample from AR24B appears to have 2 a's in addition to b replicate; may need to exclude 1 a or rename c.
Nearest station is based on a cruise-specific station list. NES-LTER standard stations L1 to L13 are the same for cruises starting with EN617 in August 2018. Prior to this: On AR22 and AR24 the NES-LTER transect was on longitude 70.83 W (to the east of present transect). AR22 Joint Program (JP) stations 1, 2, 3 correspond to AR24 LTER stations 1, 3, 5. On EN608 the NES-LTER transect was established on the present longitude 70.8833 W with standard stations L1 to L13; however, on EN608 and AR28 the position for standard station L5 was at a different latitude (1 naut. mile north of present station).
Data assembly, data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-chl-transect.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We checked differences between replicates, visually inspected plotted values, and performed a range check.
In general for the Sosik and Rynearson methods, there are 2 replicates. We'll need QA check for 2 c's, 1 d.
