Three lab groups led by PIs Sosik, Rynearson, and Menden-Deuer provide size-fractionated chlorophyll data from CTD rosette bottle and bucket sampling on NES-LTER Transect cruises. Methods specific to each lab group are distinguished in each section of methods below, and the method for each sample is identified in the column "method_contributor".

Spring and fall sample collection typically occurred on cruises funded and operated by the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). These cruises are identified with the project_id OOI, and they include data collected for both the NES-LTER and OOI projects. The Sosik lab methods (described below) are used for the data from both. Please note that OOI data are included here as a convenience to researchers wishing to use the data from both projects, and that the authoritative source for OOI data is the OOI Alfresco document server for Cruise Data from the Coastal Pioneer Array (https://alfresco.oceanobservatories.org/).

In some instances, multiple lab groups collected samples at the same site/depth at nearly the same time but from different Niskins. When this is the case, the near-simultaneous sample is indicated in the column "niskin_other_method."

# CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER Transect Cruises

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Some samples were collected at the surface with a bucket, and they are identified with cast and Niskin of 0. 

Sosik: At surface depths and at additional depths at high-priority stations, samples were collected for both <10 micron and whole seawater size fractions, with <10 micron sampling at depth targeted to the subsurface chlorophyll max (SCM) and another depth with detectable CTD fluorescence. At the remaining depths with detectable CTD fluorescence, samples were not size-fractioned. For each sample, two to three replicate bottles were filled from each Niskin and were stored in a cooler until filtered on-ship. 

Rynearson: Samples were collected from LTER stations, aiming for 12 samples per station comprised of 2 size fractions (>5 and >20 micron) from each of 3 (sometimes 4) depths: surface, SCM, and below SCM (or other). For each depth, duplicate bottles were filled with seawater and returned to the ship's lab for filtering. 
On cruises EN608, EN617, and EN627: Samples were collected from each of 6 stations and consisted of 2 size fractions (>5 and >20 micron) from 2-3 depths. For each depth, a 1-L sample bottle was filled with seawater and returned to the ship's lab for filtering. 

Menden-Deuer: The Menden-Deuer group conducts incubation experiments at some LTER stations; chlorophyll is provided here only for the starting point (time zero). Seawater from 2-4 Niskins collected near the surface (and sometimes at depth) is transferred to a 10-L polycarbonate carboy through a 200 micron mesh prefilter. Pooled Niskins are identified in the "niskin" field as, for example, "11-12-13-14". Occasionally multiple casts in one location were used for these pooled samples, and these are indicated with cast identifiers such as "18-19". Triplicate 120-150 mL subsamples were collected from the carboys for each of the size fractions, which included >20, >10, >5, and >0 microns for cruises EN608, EN617, and EN627; since cruise EN644 only the >10 and >0 microns.

#  Chlorophyll Filtering Protocol

Sosik: For each sample, a known volume was filtered through a GF/F filter under low vacuum suction (5-10 in. Hg). The <10 micron size fraction was separated using a filter funnel containing a 10 micron Nitex mesh screen above the GF/F. Filters were transferred to tissue capsules and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. Typically 2 replicates were filtered from a given Niskin bottle, and these are indicated by a or b in the data table.

Rynearson: Size fractionation was accomplished by filtering the water from one bottle from each depth through a 5 micron Sterlitech polycarbonate filter and one through a 20 micron Sterlitech polycarbonate filter under low vacuum suction (5-10 in. Hg). Filters were transferred to 5 mL cryogenic vials and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until being extracted. Rynearson lab group usually has 2 replicates from the same niskin bottle, indicated by a or b in the data table.
On cruise EN608 and EN617: Samples were filtered by homogenizing a 1-L bottle and pouring 200 mL through each of a 5 micron polycarbonate filter and a 20 micron polycarbonate filter with vacuum <20 kpa. On EN608 only: each filter was transferred to a tube containing 6 mL of 90% acetone previously chilled to -20 C, returned to -20 C, and extracted 20-30 hours later.

Menden-Deuer: Size fractionation was accomplished by filtering each sample through a GF/F (nominal 0.7 micron pore size) or 25 mm-diameter 5 micron (Poretics Polyester GVS Life Sciences), 10 micron (Isopore PolyCarbonate Millipore), or 20 micron (Polycarbonate Maine Manufacturing) filter on a manifold with vacuum not exceeding 200 mBar.  Filters were transferred to glass tubes containing 6 mL 95% ethanol at room temperature for extraction on board ship. Menden-Deuer lab group usually has 3 replicates from multiple Niskin bottles combined from same depth, indicated by a, b, or c in the data table.

# Chlorophyll a Measurement

Sosik: Back at the shore lab, filters were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and transferred to glass test tubes. They were then extracted in 5 mL of 90% acetone for 24 hours in a dark refrigerator. They were then vortexed and centrifuged. The solution was measured on a Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer, acidified with 2 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples, and the fluorometer was calibrated approximately annually using a serial dilution of a stock solution made from commercially available chlorophyll a from spinach (Sigma-Aldrich). 

On cruise EN608, the majority of samples were measured at sea. Eight of the extracted samples on cruise EN608 were measured by both the Sosik and Rynearson labs.

Rynearson: Filters for the Rynearson group were extracted in the tubes in which they were frozen, following the protocol described above for the Sosik group, then vortexed (without being centrifuged), and read on the same Turner Designs Handheld Aquafluor fluorometer as the Sosik group.
On cruise EN608 only: Processing occurred on board ship. Tubes were removed from freezer shortly before processing, vortexed for 10 seconds, and (begining with cast 15) centrifuged for 3 minutes. The supernatant was measured on a Turner Designs 10-AU-005 Benchtop Fluorometer, acidified with 2-3 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid, and measured again. If the chlorophyll readings were over the range of the fluorometer, the solution was diluted as needed. A blank and a solid standard were measured at the beginning and end of each batch of samples. Eight of the EN608 extracted samples were measured by both the Sosik and Rynearson labs.

Menden-Deuer: On board ship, filters were extracted for 12 h +/-2 h in darkness at room temperature. Then, in the presence of only red light, each tube was vortexed for 10 seconds, and its solution was poured into a new tube and measured on a Turner Designs 10-AU-005 Benchtop Fluorometer. Two drops of 10% hydrochloric acid were added to each tube, and it was measured again. If the reading after acidification was the same as the reading before acidification, an additional drop of acid was added and the sample was read again. Tubes were measured 30 seconds to one hour after acidification. Before and after each batch of samples, a blank, blank + acid, and a solid standard were measured. 

# Data Assembly and Cleaning

The data table was assembled from four sources: 1) the REST Application Programming Interface (API) of the NES-LTER data system, 2) data sheets provided by the Menden-Deuer lab, 3) a data sheet provided by the Rynearson lab for cruise EN608, 4) a data sheet including 19 values for which the CTD metadata are missing.

We added CTD bottle metadata (time, latitude, longitude, depth) from the NES-LTER REST API, identify when there are corresponding samples with values measured for multiple lab groups for the same (or paired) cast at same depth, then merge the REST API and Menden-Deuer data.

We calculated the distance from each sample collection to the nearest NES-LTER standard station L1 to L13 (standard for cruises starting with EN617 in August 2018).

Data cleaning included rounding values. 

Data assembly, data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-chl-transect.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. We checked differences between replicates, visually inspected plots of chl values colored by filter size, and performed range checks. 

We provide a column in the data table to indicate quality using IODE Primary Level flags 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data. The Menden-Deuer lab provides IODE flags directly, within their data sheets. The Sosik and Rynearson labs provide internal quality flags that are converted to IODE flags. Any sample with a negative phaeopigment value is provided with a flag of 3 (questionable). Samples with a flag of 4 (bad) are provided with chlorophyll/phaeopigment value of NA.

# Differences From Previous Version

Samples from several cruises were added, approximately doubling the number of records compared to version 1. Some records from version 1 were slightly changed, reflecting updated calibration values, and some flags were updated. The order of records was updated to chronological. The definition for the column project_id changed. Version 2 does not include the column alternate_sample_id with OOI filter identifier. The data table name has been updated to distinguish from the nes-lter-chl-transect-underway-discrete package. The author list has been updated.
