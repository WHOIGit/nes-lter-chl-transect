Size-fractionated chlorophyll a and pheophytin a are measured from water column bottle samples taken on NES-LTER Transect cruises (ongoing since 2017), as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Sampling frequency is approximately seasonal. Samples were processed by three lab groups using different methods. Four size fractions are included in addition to whole seawater (>0.7 micron): >5 , <10, >10, and >20 microns. All lab groups usually have 2 replicates indicated by a or b in the data table, and the Menden-Deuer group usually has a 3rd replicate c. These pigments are analyzed using a fluorometer in which fluorescence is measured versus a blank and a standard, and final concentrations are calculated in micrograms per liter (or mg per cubic meter). Some of the data are from cruises in collaboration with the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI).
